# project5-An-Interactive-Quiz
The Abortion quiz is inspired from the project On abortion by a research based artist Laia Abril working with photography, text, video and sound. She moved to New York to focus on photography where she decided to start telling intimate stories that raise uneasy and hidden realities related with sexuality, eating disorders and gender equality. Under “natural” circumstances, the average woman would fall pregnant about 15 times in her life, resulting in ten births. Seven of those infants would survive childhood. For centuries, people have searched for ways to delay or terminate pregnancy. Today, safe and efficient means of abortion finally exist, yet women around the world continue to use ancient, illegal or risky home methods. The quiz serves the purpose to educate the knowledge on abortion and call on attention to this social topic.
